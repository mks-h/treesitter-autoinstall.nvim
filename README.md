# treesitter-autoinstall

This is a very simple Neovim plugin that provides automatic installation for
the new rewrite of [nvim-treesitter][nvim-treesitter], since it no longer has
this option.

[nvim-treesitter]: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/tree/main

## Usage

You need to call the setup function in order for the plugin to work.

```lua
require("treesitter-autoinstall").setup()
```

### Configuration

The following is the implicit plugin configuration. You can specify just the
options you need. Notice that they are different from the original
`nvim-treesitter` options â€” both in name *and* behaviour.

```lua
require("treesitter-autoinstall").setup({
    -- A list of *filetypes* to ignore.
	ignore = {},
    -- Auto-enable highlighting for installed grammars.
	highlight = true,
    -- A list of *filetypes* to also enable regex highlighting for
	regex = {},
})
```
